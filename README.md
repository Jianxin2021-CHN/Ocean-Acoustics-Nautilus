# Nautilus: A Foundation Model for Ocean Acoustics

## Overview

**Nautilus** is a foundation model for ocean acoustic analysis, with a primary focus on **vocalization identification of marine mammals**. It aims to rapidly filter high-value marine mammal acoustic signals from large-scale underwater sound datasets.

Nautilus supports a wide range of downstream tasks, including:

- Fine-grained acoustic target classification

- Underwater acoustic source localization and tracking

- Biological species/population abundance estimation

- Distributed cooperative sensing by ocean mobile platforms

This project contributes to the protection of global marine biodiversity and promotes sustainable development and utilization of marine biological resources through the power of underwater acoustic big data.
